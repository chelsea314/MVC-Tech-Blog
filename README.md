# Module-14---MVC-Tech-Blog

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. 

This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

The comment feature is not working as of yet. It will come soon.
